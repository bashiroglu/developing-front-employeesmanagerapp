This is my first React project which I code without any tutorial, however sometimes I need some information in particiculat topics, I refresh my knowledge about it. Firstly, I used class based components but then I transfered it to functional components. As a framework I used Bootstarp to not lose time with styling, instead focus on React logic.

My mistakes for this project:

- I did have some photos of pages but not components, next time I would prepare pages but also components in addition.

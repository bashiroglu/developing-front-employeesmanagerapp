## Employee Manager App

This is my first React project which I code without any tutorial, however sometimes I need some tecnical knowledge in particular topics and I refresh my knowledge about it. Firstly, I used class based components but then I transfered it to functional components to practice hooks and state. As a front-end library I used Bootstarp to not lose time with styling, instead focus on React logic.

###### In this application I prefered to go wide rather than deep. I tried to add as much features as possible but I made many bugs while adding features.

Business Logic: As a part time, I work in a plant and because all workers are temporary, we send our shift for next week via Whatsapp. But it is very problematic because someone otherside of Whatsapp take our data and work on it by transfering it to excell file. Because of this chain many problem occure, additionally it is very hard to cancel our shift because someone should allocate time for that. This application is my soluction for that problem. As a starting I won't add lot's of features, I try to finish application then to improve it.

###### My mistakes for this project:

- I did have some photos of pages but not components, next time I would prepare pages but also components in addition.

- I used employees and users but they both are the same, I wouldn't do this next time or I would distinguish them, in other words I wouldn't use these two words interchangeably.

###### Weaknesses of project:

1. In front side I only check if user logged in and protect the normal user seeing the admin routes only simple if check which allow user seeing navlinks which take them to protected routes. But I plan to add protecting to back-end, as a result user can not make request anyway.

2. When I create token, I don't take care of expire-date. This is not good at all. But for simplicity sake, I did like that in particular project.

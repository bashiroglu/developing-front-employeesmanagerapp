This is my first React project which I code without any tutorial, however sometimes I need some information in particiculat topics, I refresh my knowledge about it. Firstly, I used class based components but then I transfered it to functional components. As a framework I used Bootstarp to not lose time with styling, instead focus on React logic.

Business Logic: As a part time, I work in a plant and because all workers are temporary, we send our shift for next week via Whatsapp. But it is very problematic because someone otherside of Whatsapp take our data and work on it by transfering it to excell file. Because of this chain many problem occure, additionally it is very hard to cancel our shift because someone should allocate time for that. This application is my soluction for that problem. As a starting I won't add lot's of features, I try to finish application then to improve it. 

My mistakes for this project:

- I did have some photos of pages but not components, next time I would prepare pages but also components in addition.
